          Search request allows you to get products that match your search
          criteria.


          It allows you create many custom APIs for your use case.


          If the search query parameter has 2 possible values, they are
          seperated by a comma(,).

          When filtering via a parameter that has different language codes like
          `fr`, `de` or `en`, specify the language code in the parameter name
          e.g `categories_tags_en`


          **Important:** search API v2 does not support full text request
          (search_term),

          you have to use [search API
          v1](https://wiki.openfoodfacts.org/API/Read/Search) for that.

          Upcoming [search-a-licious
          project](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/search-a-licious) will fix
          that.


          ### Limiting results


          You can limit the size of returned objects thanks to the `fields`
          object (see below).


          eg: `fields=code,product_name,brands,attribute_groups``


          Please use it as much as possible to avoid overloading the servers.


          The search use pagination, see `page` and `page_size` parameters.


          **Beware:** the `page_count` data in item is a bit counter intuitive…,
          read the description.


          ### Conditions on tags


          All `_tags`` parameters accepts either:


          * a single value

          * or a comma-separated list of values (doing a AND)

          * or a pipe separated list of values (doing a OR)


          You can exclude terms by using a "-" prefix.


          For taxonomized entries, you might either use the tag id
          (recommended),

          or a known synonym (without language prefix)


          * `labels_tags=en:organic,en:fair-trade` find items that are
          fair-trade AND organic

          * `labels_tags=en:organic|en:fair-trade` find items that are
          fair-trade OR organic

          * `labels_tags=en:organic,en:-fair-trade` find items that are organic
          BUT NOT fair-trade



          ### Conditions on nutriments


          To get a list of nutrients


          You can either query on nutrient per 100g (`_100g` suffix)

          or per serving (`serving` suffix).


          You can also add `_prepared_`

          to get the nutrients in the prepared product instead of as sold.


          You can add a comparison operator and value to the parameter name

          to get products with nutrient above or bellow a value.

          If you use a parameter value it exactly match it.


          * `energy-kj_100g<200` products where energy in kj for 100g is less
          than 200kj

          * `sugars_serving>10` products where sugar per serving is greater than
          10g

          * `saturated-fat_100g=1` products where saturated fat per 100g is
          exactly 10g

          * `salt_prepared_serving<0.1` products where salt per serving for
          prepared product is less than 0.1g
