          Predictions are performed using a neural model.
          As input, you can either provide:

          - the `barcode` of a product: Robotoff will fetch the product from
            Product Opener and will use this data as inputs to predict categories.
          - expected inputs under a `product` key. The neural category model
            accepts the following fields as input: `product_name`, `ingredients_tags`,
            `ocr`, `nutriments`, `image_embeddings`. All fields are optional (but you should at least provide one).
