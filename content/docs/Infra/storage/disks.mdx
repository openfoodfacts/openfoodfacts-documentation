# Disk Management

## Best Practices

<Callout type="info">
  Always try to separate: primary data, cache data (data generated from primary
  data), configuration data, and system. This makes data management (backup,
  recovery, day to day maintenance) easier.
</Callout>

<Cards>
  <Card title="Data Separation">
    Separate primary data, cache data, configuration data, and system data for
    easier management
  </Card>
  <Card title="ZFS Datasets">
    In ZFS use different datasets for different types of data
  </Card>
  <Card title="NFS for Large Data">
    For backup data or large data with few I/O operations eventually use NFS
    mount from a separate server

## Health Monitoring with Smartctl

Some useful commands for disk health monitoring:

<Callout type="info">
  ```bash title="Complete Disk Information" smartctl -x ``` This gives you every
  information about a system.
</Callout>

### Key Health Indicators

<Steps>
<Step>
**Overall Health Assessment**
Be attentive to `SMART overall-health self-assessment test result`.
</Step>

<Step>
  **Error Count Verification** Also verify `Device Error Count`. (you can see
  errors with `smartctl -l error`)
</Step>

<Step>
  **Self-Test Results** Verify that tests under `SMART Extended Self-test`
  finished. (you can see tests with `smartctl -l selftest`)
</Step>

<Step>
**Manual Testing**
Use `smartctl -t short /dev/sdX` to test a single device. (or `-t long`)
</Step>
</Steps>
