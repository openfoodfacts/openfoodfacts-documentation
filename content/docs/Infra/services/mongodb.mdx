# MongoDB Management

MongoDB is the database used to search products and run aggregations (like facets), etc.

<Cards>
  <Card title="Production Instance">
    We have a single instance in production
  </Card>
  <Card title="Staging Instance">
    For staging also we have a single instance
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Refresh Products Scripts

<Callout type="info">
The machine with MongoDB must have a product opener clone to be able to run [`refresh_products_tags.js`](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server/blob/640c6d1d8c121bbe2987e4811a555b9305ae2a62/scripts/refresh_products_tags.js) in crontab.

This creates small collections that are used for aggregations (mainly for facets for anonymous users).

</Callout>

## Deployment Environments

<Tabs items={["staging", "production"]}>
<Tab value="staging">
<Card title="Staging Deployment">
This is an instance for staging (aka .net) product opener instances.
</Card>

<Callout type="info">
It is deployed on [staging containers VM](/docs/Infra/containerization/docker-architecture#docker-server-for-staging).

See https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server/blob/main/.github/workflows/mongo-deploy.yml script.

</Callout>
</Tab>

<Tab value="production">
<Card title="Production Setup">
We installed the [MongoDB Community Edition Packages](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-debian/#std-label-debian-package-content) for Debian in version 4.4.x.
</Card>

<Callout type="info">
  Currently this is hosted on off3, a temporary server gracefully lended by OSM
  France, you can access it via ssh from off1 or off2 as root (`sudo ssh
  10.0.0.3`).
</Callout>

### Configuration

The configuration file is in `/etc/mongod.conf`.

<Cards>
  <Card title="Storage Path">
    `storage.dbPath` is set to a specific volume: `/mongo/db`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Log Rotation">
    `systemLog.LogRotate` is set to `reopen` (needed by logrotate)
  </Card>
  <Card title="PID File Path">
    `processManagement.pidFilePath` is set to `"/var/run/mongodb/mongod.pid"`
  </Card>
</Cards>

<Callout type="warning">
I also had to create the `/var/run/mongodb` directory and give it to `mongodb` user:

```bash title="Create MongoDB Runtime Directory"
mkdir /var/run/mongodb/
chown mongodb:mongodb /var/run/mongodb/
```

</Callout>

### Log Rotation

<Callout type="info">
  In production, logs have to be rotated. Following [this blog
  post](https://www.zoonman.com/blog/mongodb-logrotated/) cross checked with
  official docs.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
**Configure MongoDB**
See above to configure `/etc/mongod.conf` correctly.
</Step>

<Step>
**Setup Main Log Rotation**
Create `/etc/logrotate.d/mongod`:

```bash title="/etc/logrotate.d/mongod"
/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log
{
   # keep 7 files (one week)
   rotate 7
   # every day
   daily
   # min file size
   size 100M
   # no problem if it does not yet exists
   missingok
   # create it if needed with owner mongodb
   create 0600 mongodb mongodb
   # compress only old file (as switch is not immediate)
   delaycompress
   # but compress old archives
   compress
   # the postrotate tells mongo to change log
   # Be sure to have processManagement.pidFilePath set to this path in mongod.conf
   # and that folder exists and is owned by mongodb
   sharedscripts
   postrotate
     /bin/kill -SIGUSR1 $(cat /var/run/mongodb/mongod.pid)
   endscript
}
```

</Step>

<Step>
**Setup Refresh Tags Log Rotation**
We also have logs for refresh products tags `/etc/logrotate.d/mongo_refresh_tags`:

```bash title="/etc/logrotate.d/mongo_refresh_tags"
/var/log/mongodb/refresh_products_tags_*.log
{
  rotate 7
  weekly
  size 100M
  missingok
  # we don't know when logrotate will happen
  # script might be working, so only compress previous files
  delaycompress
  compress
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  On staging logs are sent to docker stdout/err and we let docker handle logs.
