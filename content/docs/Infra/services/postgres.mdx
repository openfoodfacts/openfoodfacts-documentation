# PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a database used in various sub projects at Open Food Facts.

<Callout type="info">
PostgreSQL serves different purposes across our infrastructure, from primary data storage in Docker Compose projects to transient task queues in Product Opener.
</Callout>

## Production Deployment

<Cards>
  <Card title="Docker Compose Projects" href="#docker-compose-projects">
    Dedicated PostgreSQL instances for microservices like Robotoff and OpenFoodFacts Query
  </Card>
  <Card title="Product Opener" href="#product-opener">
    PostgreSQL used for Minion task management in containerized environments
  </Card>
</Cards>

### Docker Compose Projects

Docker compose based projects like Robotoff or OpenFoodFacts Query use their own instance of the database in Docker containers.

<Callout type="warn">
If data in the database is the primary source, it is advised to have a backup volume (typically an NFS or ZFS volume) to backup the database regularly with `pg_dump`. It might be more reliable and manageable than to only rely on the filesystem snapshot made by Proxmox/ZFS.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Set up Docker Compose PostgreSQL**
    
    Configure your PostgreSQL instance within the Docker Compose stack.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Configure Backup Volume**
    
    Set up NFS or ZFS volume for reliable database backups.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Implement pg_dump Backups**
    
    Schedule regular `pg_dump` operations for data protection.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Product Opener

For Product Opener instances we only use PostgreSQL for Minion tasks.

<Callout type="info">
It is deployed in a Proxmox container. Right now there is no customization. Backup is not implemented as it contains transient data.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
**TODO:** At least have data in a ZFS volume (through a bind mount)?
</Callout>
