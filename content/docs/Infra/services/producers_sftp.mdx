<Card title="Secure File Transfer for Producers" description="Automated product update system via SFTP">

The Producers SFTP is part of the producer platform, enabling producers to send files for regular automated updates of their products.

</Card>

## Overview

<Tabs items={["Purpose", "Architecture", "Security"]}>
  <Tab value="Purpose">
    ### Use Case
    - **Automated Updates:** Producers upload files for regular product updates
    - **Bulk Processing:** Handles large-scale product data imports
    - **Integration:** Part of the broader producer platform ecosystem
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="Architecture">
    ### System Location
    - **Host:** Reverse proxy container (requires dedicated network interface)
    - **Storage:** ZFS dataset `zfs-hdd/off-pro/sftp`
    - **Mount Point:** `/mnt/off-pro/sftp`
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="Security">
    ### Security Model
    - **Group Isolation:** All users must be in `sftponly` group exclusively
    - **Key-based Auth:** Support for SSH public key authentication
    - **Network Isolation:** Runs on dedicated container with network interface
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Storage Configuration

### Mount Points

The SFTP directory is mounted in two locations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reverse Proxy Container">
    Mounted as `/mnt/off-pro/sftp` to provide SFTP access to producers
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="OFF-Pro Container">
    Also mounted to give the producer platform access to uploaded files
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
This dual-mount approach allows secure file upload while enabling platform processing.
</Callout>

## SFTP Configuration

### Configuration File

The SFTP service is configured in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/sftp.conf`, which is a symlink to `confs/proxy-off/sshd_config/sftp.conf` in this repository.

### SSH Key Authentication

<Steps>
  <Step title="Public Key Placement">
    For key-based authentication, place the producer's public key in:
    ```bash
    /mnt/off-pro/sftp/<username>_authorized_keys
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="File Permissions">
    Ensure proper file permissions for security
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Group Membership">
    Verify user is in `sftponly` group only
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding New SFTP Users

### User Creation Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run Script">
    Execute the user creation script:
    ```bash title="Add SFTP User"
    # Run as root in the reverse proxy container
    ./script/off-proxy/add_sftp_user.pl
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Group Assignment">
    **Critical:** Ensure every user is in the `sftponly` group and **only** in this group
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="SSH Key Setup">
    If using key authentication, configure the authorized_keys file
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Access">
    Verify the setup before notifying the producer
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="error">
**CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENT:** Every user **must be in `sftponly` group** and only in this group. This ensures proper access control and security isolation.
</Callout>

## Testing and Verification

### Server Key Fingerprint

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Fingerprint">
    Obtain server key fingerprint for producer verification:
    ```bash title="Get SSH Fingerprint"
    ssh-keyscan $(hostname) | ssh-keygen -lf -
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Share with Producer">
    Communicate the fingerprint to the producer for host verification
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Connection Testing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test with LFTP">
    Test SFTP access before notifying the producer:
    ```bash title="Test SFTP Connection"
    lftp sftp://user@sftp.openfoodfacts.org
    password:
    > ls
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Commands">
    Issue at least an `ls` command, as `lftp` only connects on the first command
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Upload">
    Verify file upload capabilities if required
  </Step>
</Steps>

    ### User Security
    
    <Cards>
      <Card title="Group Isolation" description="sftponly group membership exclusively" />
      <Card title="Key Authentication" description="Prefer SSH keys over passwords" />
      <Card title="Regular Audits" description="Review user access periodically" />
    </Cards>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="Access Control">
    ### Permission Management
    
    - **Directory Permissions:** Proper ownership and permissions on SFTP directories
    - **File Access:** Limited to necessary directories only
    - **Network Isolation:** Container-based network separation
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="Monitoring">
    ### Operational Monitoring
    
    - **Connection Logs:** Monitor SFTP access patterns
    - **File Activity:** Track upload/download activities
    - **Security Events:** Alert on suspicious access attempts
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Architecture Integration

### Data Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Producer Upload">
    Producers upload files via SFTP to their designated directories
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Platform Processing">
    OFF-Pro container accesses files for automated processing
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Product Updates">
    Processed data updates products in the main database
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Cleanup">
    Processed files are moved or archived according to retention policies
  </Step>
</Steps>
