<Callout type="info">
    Focusing on the developer onboarding process into a project is a very important step to make a repository popular: no one wants to struggle for hours to setup an application and start developing on it.
</Callout>

A streamlined and easy setup process is thus critical to having meaningful contributions on an open-source repository.

## Rules of the OFF Onboarding Process

The setup steps should be as simple as possible and stick by the following rules:

<Steps>
    <Step >
        ### Respect the User's Time
        - Reduce the amount of time needed to setup a project to the least amount possible
        - Make it as fast as possible to take into account code modifications (ideally live reload, if needed a container restart)
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Accessibility for Non-Developers
        Make it easy for non-developers to contribute: the dev setup should not require a high comprehension of the application at hand
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Repeatable and Tested Workflow
        The dev setup should be automated and tested with every pull request to ensure that it does not break accidentally when making changes
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Wide Platform Support
        Try to make the dev deployment platform agnostic, at least for commands used to develop in a normal process
    </Step>
</Steps>

    **Platform Compatibility Note:**
    On Windows, git comes with *git bash* which should be privileged as a console. You can use symlink on Windows.
</Callout>

    The `make dev` command should work across all repos to streamline the applications setup process.
