# How to Deploy a New Service

Open Food Facts is made of several components and tools for the community and infrastructure management.

<Callout type="info">
  Each service will cost resources and have certain requirements to run. It's
  important to keep those things in mind when deploying a new service.
</Callout>

## Deployment Process Overview

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Decide Deployment Method** Choose between Docker Compose or Proxmox
    containers based on service requirements.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Select Target Server** Choose the best server considering resources,
    latency, and criticality.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Separate Data from System** Implement proper data separation for
    reliability and maintenance.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Monitor Performance** Track system performance before and after
    deployment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deployment Methods

<Tabs items={["docker", "proxmox"]}>
  <Tab value="docker">
    ### Docker Compose Deployment
    <Callout type="info">
      Using [Docker Compose](/docs/Infra/containerization/docker-architecture)
      is the **preferred way** to deploy services that have active development.
    </Callout>
    **Benefits:** - Easy upgrade of main components - Good reproducibility of
    the environment - Excellent integration with [CI/CD
    tools](/docs/Infra/configuration/cicd) **Deployment target:** - Deploy in a
    VM (recommended) - Container deployment is experimental (no official support
    yet)
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="proxmox">
    ### Proxmox Container Deployment
    <Callout type="info">
      Using a [Proxmox
      container](/docs/Infra/virtualization/proxmox#how-to-create-a-new-container)
      is the second-best option.
    </Callout>
    **Best for:** - Services packaged in Debian - Software that updates easily
    in container environments (e.g., PHP applications) **Use cases:** - Static
    services with minimal development - Well-established applications with
    stable requirements
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Server Selection

<Callout type="warning">
  Server selection should be done in coordination with the infrastructure team.
</Callout>

    CPU, RAM, and storage needs analysis
  </Card>
  <Card title="Network Latency" href="#factors-to-consider">
    Access to other services and external systems
  </Card>
  <Card title="Service Criticality" href="#factors-to-consider">
    Uptime requirements and failure impact
  </Card>
</Cards>

### Factors to Consider

- **Resources needed by the service**: CPU, RAM, storage requirements
- **Latency needed to access other services**: Network topology considerations
- **How critical the service is**: Uptime requirements and redundancy needs

## Separating Data from System

<Callout type="info">
  It's important to try to separate data from the system for reliability and
  maintainability.
</Callout>

### Data Types

<Cards>
  <Card title="Primary Source Data">
    Critical data that cannot be regenerated
  </Card>
  <Card title="Indexes">
    Data that can be rebuilt from primary sources
  </Card>
  <Card title="Caches & Temp Data">
    Temporary data that can be safely lost
  </Card>
  <Card title="Logs & Configs">
    System logs and configuration files
  </Card>
</Cards>

### Benefits of Data Separation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Safe System Updates** Update the system without putting data at risk and
    enable rollback without losing data.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Performance Optimization** Put data on faster disks if needed for better
    performance.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Backup Strategy** Implement targeted backup strategies for different data
    types.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  If your service is not very important, doesn't have much data, and you can
  afford losing some data, separation might not be worth the effort.
</Callout>

## Performance Monitoring

<Callout type="warning">
  If your service is heavy duty, try to do some performance checks in staging
  before production deployment.
</Callout>

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

After deployment, check how the new service impacts overall system performance.

<Callout type="info">
  [Munin](/docs/Infra/monitoring/munin) offers a good way to check system
  performance, as you can compare before and after deployment metrics.
</Callout>

### Key Performance Indicators

<Cards>
  <Card title="CPU Usage" >
    Monitor CPU utilization and I/O wait time
  </Card>
  <Card title="Memory Usage">
    Track RAM consumption and swap usage
  </Card>
  <Card title="Disk Usage">
    Monitor utilization per device and I/O patterns
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pressure Stall Information">
    Identify bottlenecks between CPU, disk, and RAM
  </Card>
