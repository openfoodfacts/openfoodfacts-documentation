Learn how to configure and use Fail2ban to protect your servers from malicious bots and automated attacks.

<Callout type="info">
  Fail2ban monitors log files and automatically bans IP addresses that show
  malicious behavior, such as too many authentication failures or bot-like
  activity.
</Callout>

## Installation and Setup

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Install Fail2ban**
    ```bash title="Install Fail2ban"
    sudo apt install fail2ban
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Debian 11+ Configuration**
    <Callout type="info">
      On Debian 11, additional configuration is required. Follow [How to install
      fail2ban on debian 11+](/docs/Infra/how/how-to-fail2ban-debian-11pluse)
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Standard Filter Configuration

<Callout type="info">
  We install these filters with standard configurations across our
  infrastructure.
</Callout>

<Cards>

    Bans bots that blindly search for old software installations
  </Card>
  <Card title="nginx-http-auth">
    Bans bots making too many failed authentication attempts
  </Card>
  <Card title="sshd">

## Manual Ban Jail Configuration

Create a jail for manually banning problematic IP addresses that automated filters might miss.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Enable Manual Ban Jail**
    ```bash title="Enable nginx-manual-ban Jail"
    ln -s /opt/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/confs/common/fail2ban-nftables/jail.d/nginx-manual-ban.local /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/
    systemctl restart fail2ban
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **How It Works** - Uses `nginx-botsearch` filter on a fake log file - Allows
    manual IP addition to the jail - Permanent ban time for manually added IPs
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  **Persistence**: Fail2ban (recent versions) is naturally persistent across
  reboots using a SQLite database in `/var/lib/fail2ban/`.
</Callout>

## Managing Fail2ban

<Tabs items={["status", "management"]}>
  <Tab value="status">
    ### Status and Logs
    
    ```bash title="Check Overall Status"
    fail2ban-client status  # See all running jails
    ```
    
    ```bash title="Check Specific Jail"
    fail2ban-client status sshd  # Status for specific jail: banned addresses, etc.
    ```
    
    ```bash title="Monitor Logs"
    tail -f /var/log/fail2ban.log  # Watch fail2ban activity in real-time
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="management">
    ### View Banned IPs
    
    ```bash title="List Banned IPs"
    sudo fail2ban-client status nginx-manual-ban
    ```
    
    ### Ban an IP Address
    
    ```bash title="Manual IP Ban"
    sudo fail2ban-client set nginx-manual-ban banip <IP>
    ```
    
    <Callout type="info">
    Supports IP ranges: `123.456.789.1/24`
    </Callout>
    
    ### Unban an IP Address
    
    ```bash title="Unban IP"
    sudo fail2ban-client set nginx-manual-ban unbanip <IP>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Common Operations

### Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Regular Monitoring** Check fail2ban status regularly to ensure it's
    working correctly.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Log Review** Monitor `/var/log/fail2ban.log` for patterns and false
    positives.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Whitelist Management** Ensure legitimate IP ranges are whitelisted to
    prevent accidental bans.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Filter Tuning** Adjust filter sensitivity based on actual attack patterns
    observed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Be careful when manually banning IP ranges. Always verify you're not blocking
  legitimate traffic or your own access paths.
