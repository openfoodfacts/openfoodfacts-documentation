# How to Have Server Config in Git

We use Git to store and track server/container/VM specific configurations for better management and version control.

<Callout type="info">
  See [Explanation on server configuration with
  Git](/docs/Infra/configuration/explain-server-config-in-git) for detailed
  concepts and rationale.
</Callout>

## Repository Setup Overview

  </Card>
</Cards>

## Setup the Repository

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Clone Location** Clone the repository as root to
    `/opt/openfoodfacts-infrastructure`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Authentication Setup** Use a [deploy
    key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys)
    for repository access.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Clone Repository**
    ```bash title="Clone Infrastructure Repository"
    cd /opt
    git clone git@github.com-my-project:openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-infrastructure.git
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### SSH Key Management

<Tabs>
  <Tab value="single" label="Single Repository">
    ### Create SSH Key If root doesn't have an SSH key yet: ```bash
    title="Generate SSH Key" ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C
    "root@some-descriptive-host-name" ```
    <Steps>
      <Step>
        **Copy Public Key**
        ```bash title="Get Public Key"
        cat /root/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step>
        **Add Deploy Key** Add the public key as a [deploy key to this
        repository](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/settings/keys)
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="multiple" label="Multiple Repositories">
    ### Multiple Repository Access
    <Callout type="info">
      GitHub only allows one repository per public key. For multiple
      repositories, create separate keys with SSH config aliases.
    </Callout>
    <Steps>
      <Step>
        **Create Project-Specific Key**
        ```bash title="Generate Project Key"
        ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "root@my-project-my-server-name" -f "/root/.ssh/github_my-project"
        cat /root/.ssh/github_my-project.pub
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step>
        **Configure SSH Client** Edit `/root/.ssh/config`:
        ```ini title="SSH Config"
        Host github.com-my-project
        Hostname github.com
        IdentityFile=/root/.ssh/github_my-project
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step>
        **Clone with Alias**
        ```bash title="Clone with SSH Alias"
        git clone git@github.com-my-project:my-org/my-project.git
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    <Callout type="info">
      See [GitHub
      documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys#using-multiple-repositories-on-one-server)
      for more details.

## Store Server Configurations

<Callout type="info">
  See [Explanation on server configuration with
  Git](/docs/Infra/configuration/explain-server-config-in-git) for concepts and
  implementation details.
</Callout>

### Configuration Structure

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Create Service Folder** Create a folder for your service in the `confs/`
    directory.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Mirror /etc Structure** Create a structure that loosely mimics `/etc` for
    files you need to modify.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Symlink Files** Symlink `/etc` files to your repository files for
    automatic synchronization.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Important Considerations

<Callout type="error">
  **NEVER** put files with passwords in the Git repository! See [Files with
  passwords](#files-with-passwords) section.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  **Proxmox Special Case**: `/etc/pve` on Proxmox hosts is a specific FUSE mount
  that exposes Proxmox configuration as files. You won't be able to use symlinks
  for this part.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  **Logrotate Requirement**: Logrotate needs files to be owned by root, or it
  will fail silently.
</Callout>

## Files with Passwords

<Callout type="warning">
  Isolate private files with minimal content as much as possible. Most services
  support this through includes or specific directives.
</Callout>

### Handling Sensitive Files

<Tabs>
  <Tab value="recreatable" label="Recreatable Files">
    ### Easy to Recreate For files that are easy to recreate: - Let's Encrypt
    certificates - API keys that can be regenerated - Passwords that can be
    reset easily **Solution**: Leave these files on the server only, don't
    commit to Git.
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="important" label="Important Files">
    ### Not Easy to Recreate For files that are difficult to recreate or contain
    critical data: **Solution**: Store in the shared KeePass database for secure
    backup and team access.
    <Callout type="info">
      This ensures sensitive data is backed up but not exposed in version
      control.
    </Callout>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Store Server Scripts

<Callout type="info">
  Server-specific scripts can also be stored in this repository for backup and
  evolution tracking.
</Callout>

<Cards>
  <Card title="Backup Scripts" href="#store-server-scripts">
    Keep server-specific automation scripts versioned
  </Card>
  <Card title="Evolution Tracking" href="#store-server-scripts">
    Track changes and improvements over time
  </Card>
  <Card title="Team Collaboration" href="#store-server-scripts">
    Share scripts and knowledge across team members
  </Card>
</Cards>

### Benefits of Script Storage

- **Version Control**: Track script evolution and changes
- **Backup**: Ensure scripts aren't lost with server failures
- **Collaboration**: Team members can review and improve scripts
- **Documentation**: Scripts serve as infrastructure documentation
