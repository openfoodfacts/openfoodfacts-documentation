# Observability

This document describes the observability stack used at Open Food Facts to monitor applications.

<Callout type="info">
Having a good observability stack is critical to spend less time when debugging failures, to have a comprehension of how applications behave over time, and to have the ability to compare a software version with the previously deployed one.
</Callout>

## Monitoring Tools Overview

## Munin

See [Munin](./munin.md) - a tool to monitor servers and services.

## Influx / Prometheus / Grafana

See [openfoodfacts-monitoring project on GitHub](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-monitoring/)

The observability stack used in the OFF infrastructure comprises the following applications:

<Tabs>
  <Tab value="logs" label="Log Collection">
    ### Log Management
    
    - **Filebeat**: Logs collection agent deployed on each QEMU VM with Docker containers
    - **[ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html)**: Centralized storage and indexing of logs collected from Docker
    - **[Kibana](https://kibana.openfoodfacts.org/)**: UI to visualize and use logs collected by ElasticSearch [(official doc)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index.html)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="metrics" label="Metrics & Alerts">
    ### Metrics and Monitoring
    
    - **[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs)**: Scrapes metrics from Prometheus exporters' `/metrics` endpoint
    - **AlertManager**: Sends alerts based on Prometheus metrics, integrated with dedicated Slack channels
    - **[InfluxDB](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.0/)**: Storage backend for data harvested by Prometheus
    - **[Grafana](https://grafana.openfoodfacts.org/)**: Visualizing Prometheus metrics, InfluxDB and other metrics; creating dashboards [(official doc)](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="exporters" label="Exporters">
    ### Prometheus Exporters
    
    - **Prometheus exporters**: Such as the [Apache Prometheus Exporter](https://github.com/Lusitaniae/apache_exporter)
    - Collect metrics from applications and expose them on a port in the Prometheus metric format
    - Some applications natively export Prometheus metrics and do not need additional exporters
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Prometheus

<Cards>
  <Card title="Alerts" href="https://prometheus.openfoodfacts.org/alerts">
    View currently triggered alerts
  </Card>
  <Card title="Targets" href="https://prometheus.openfoodfacts.org/targets">
    Check status of services observed by Prometheus
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rules" href="https://prometheus.openfoodfacts.org/rules">
    View alerting rules configuration
  </Card>
</Cards>

### Multi-target Exporter Pattern

We use the [multi-target exporter pattern](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/multi-target-exporter/#querying-multi-target-exporters-with-prometheus) on some configurations.

<Callout type="info">
This pattern helps writing a lot of targets that follow same rules in the same way.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Initial Processing**
    
    Targets will be in `__address__` at the beginning of the process.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Address Overwrite**
    
    The last rule overwrites `__address__` to put some static value, but previous rules were already processed.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Parameter Handling**
    
    - Simple params like `instance`, `app` are parameters for the job configuration, not for the target URL
    - To add params to target URL we use `__param_xxxx` (for example `__param_target` to add a `target` parameter to URL)
    - `instance` is very important, as each job must have their separate instance name
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
You can look at https://prometheus.openfoodfacts.org/targets to see if your targets are processed correctly. A mouse over in the "labels" column shows you parameter before processing.
</Callout>

## Blackbox Exporter

Is a service that can be used by Prometheus to probe for websites.

<Callout type="info">
Prometheus will call the service as if it was a metric exporter with the appropriate target (that you set through `target` on `__param_target` in the configuration if you use [multi-target exporter pattern](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/multi-target-exporter/#querying-multi-target-exporters-with-prometheus)).
</Callout>

### Testing on Monitoring Container

Blackbox is on port 9115 so you can test it using:

```bash title="Testing Blackbox Exporter"
# HTTP probe
curl "http://localhost:9115/probe?module=http_probe&target=https%3A%2F%2Fsearch.openfoodfacts.org%2F"

# ICMP probe
curl "http://localhost:9115/probe?module=icmp&app=ovh1&target=ov1.openfoodfacts.org"
```

### Debugging Blackbox Exporter Probe Failures

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Set up SSH Tunnel**
    
    Connect via SSH to monitoring VM with port redirection:
    
    ```bash title="SSH Port Forwarding"
    ssh -L 9115:<VM internal ip>:9115 <server-name> -N
    ```
    
    Currently, this should be:
    
    ```bash title="Current SSH Command"
    ssh -L 9115:10.1.0.203:9115 ovh1.openfoodfacts.org -N
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Access Blackbox Interface**
    
    This gives you access to blackbox exporter on http://127.0.0.1:9115
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Review Probe Status**
    
    View table with current status for different probes and log of the probes.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Test Probes**
    
    Test the probe with:
    
    ```bash title="Test Probe URL"
    http://127.0.0.1:9115/probe?module=http_probe&target=https%3A%2F%2FMYSERVER.TLD/MY/PATH
    ```
    
    <Callout type="info">
    Add `debug=true` parameter to the URL to see debug output. Look for `probe_success` and `probe_http_status_code` values.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Reproduce with Curl**
    
    Try to reproduce the same probe with curl for comparison.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Exposing Metrics Behind a Proxy

<Callout type="info">
Prometheus server is in OVH datacenter. To expose metrics from Free datacenter through the internet, we use the nginx reverse proxy.
</Callout>

See free-exporters site configuration, and scraper configuration.
