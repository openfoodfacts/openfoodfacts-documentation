# Stunnel Secure Connections

Stunnel enables secure TCP connections between distant servers using OpenSSL encryption.

<Callout type="info">
Stunnel is installed on the reverse proxy of off2 and on a specific VM (113) on ovh1. For installation details, see [the install report](./reports/2024-01-04-setting-up-stunnel.md).
</Callout>

## Architecture Overview

## Client vs Server Configuration

<Callout type="warning">
Understanding the client/server distinction is critical for proper security configuration.
</Callout>

<Tabs>
  <Tab value="client" label="Client Side">
    ### Stunnel Client
    
    - **Role**: Where connections are initiated (*Stunnel Server 1* in diagram)
    - **Configuration**: `client=yes`
    - **Security**: Must **never** be exposed on public IP
    - **Location**: Internal container with private IP only
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="server" label="Server Side">
    ### Stunnel Server
    
    - **Role**: Accepts connections and forwards to target service
    - **Configuration**: `client=no` (server side)
    - **Security**: May be exposed publicly through reverse proxy
    - **Location**: Reverse proxy configuration
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Security Model

<Cards>
  <Card title="Server Side Exposure" href="#security-considerations">
    Uses reverse proxy for controlled public access
  </Card>
  <Card title="Client Side Protection" href="#security-considerations">
    Internal container with private IP only
  </Card>
  <Card title="Encryption" href="#psk">
    PSK (Private Shared Key) for secure communication
  </Card>
</Cards>

<Callout type="error">
**CRITICAL**: Always double-check to only use `client=yes` on the internal container (private network), never on the proxy exposed to public internet.
</Callout>

## Configuration

### File Location and Structure

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Configuration File**
    
    Configuration is in `/etc/stunnel/off.conf` for the `off` instance.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Service Entries**
    
    Multiple service entries can be added to serve different services.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Client/Server Setting**
    
    - Client side: `client=yes`
    - Server side: `client=no`
  </Step>
</Steps>

### PSK Security

<Callout type="info">
We use PSK (Private Shared Key) for security - easier and more performant than certificate-based authentication.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **PSK File Location**
    
    PSK files must be in `/etc/stunnel/psk/` directory.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Security Requirements**
    
    ```bash title="Secure PSK Files"
    chmod -R go-rwx /etc/stunnel/psk/
    ```
    
    <Callout type="warning">
    PSK files must **never** be committed to Git repository. Keep them on servers only.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Generate PSK**
    
    ```bash title="Generate PSK"
    pwgen 32
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Unique Usernames**
    
    Keep each username unique for each server **and** each service to avoid conflicts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration Testing

<Callout type="error">
**BEWARE**: Stunnel is used for other services! Don't restart the service without testing configuration first.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Test Configuration**
    
    Test by starting another stunnel instance:
    
    ```bash title="Test Configuration"
    stunnel /etc/stunnel/off.conf
    ```
    
    <Callout type="info">
    This will fail due to port conflicts, but you can verify if configuration parses correctly.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Restart Service**
    
    When configuration is verified:
    
    ```bash title="Restart Stunnel Service"
    systemctl restart stunnel@off
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Systemd Service

<Callout type="info">
The `stunnel@off` service corresponds to `/etc/stunnel/off.conf` configuration.
</Callout>

### Service Customizations

<Tabs>
  <Tab value="permissions" label="Permissions">
    ### PID File Handling
    
    We had to override the systemd service for PID file management:
    
    <Steps>
      <Step>
        **Root Launch**
        
        Stunnel launches as `root` to get privileges, then changes user.
      </Step>
      
      <Step>
        **PID File Creation**
        
        PID file is created with the running user.
      </Step>
      
      <Step>
        **Group Permissions**
        
        Use group `stunnel4` in service definition and add group write permission to runtime directory.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="process" label="Process Management">
    ### Foreground Execution
    
    <Callout type="info">
    Stunnel is launched in foreground mode to let systemd handle process management properly.
    </Callout>
    
    Benefits:
    - Better process supervision
    - Proper logging integration
    - Cleaner service lifecycle management
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Security Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Network Isolation**
    
    - Client side: Private networks only
    - Server side: Controlled public exposure through reverse proxy
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **PSK Management**
    
    - Generate strong PSKs (32 characters)
    - Unique usernames per server and service
    - Secure file permissions (go-rwx)
    - Never commit PSKs to version control
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Configuration Verification**
    
    - Test configurations before deployment
    - Verify client/server settings
    - Check port bindings and conflicts
  </Step>
</Steps>
