Robotoff is split into several services:

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Scheduler"
    description="Responsible for launching recurrent tasks (downloading new dataset, processing insights automatically,...)"
  />
  <Card
    title="Workers"
    description="Responsible for all long-lasting tasks (mainly insight extraction from images)"
  />
  <Card title="Public API" description="Serves the public API endpoints" />
  <Card title="Triton Service" description="Serves ML models" />
</Cards>

Two additional services are used:

- **PostgreSQL database** (_postgres_ service)
- **Elasticsearch** single node (_elasticsearch_ service)

<Callout type="info">
  All services are managed by Docker.
  [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is used to manage these
  services. `tf-serving` and `triton` have their own file: `docker/ml.yml`. ML
  models are stored as releases at
  https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff-models.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  All Robotoff services are running on one of the two Docker instances (OVH 200
  VM for staging and OVH 201 VM for production). You should use the proxy
  servers (ovh1.openfoodfacts.org or ovh2.openfoodfacts.org) to reach these
  instances. You can get more information on Docker VMs
  [here](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-infrastructure/blob/develop/docs/docker_architecture.md).
</Callout>

## Quick Start

See [dev-install](/docs/Robotoff/how-to-guides/deployment/dev-install) for initial setup.

You can then use:

- `docker compose start [service-name]` or `docker compose stop [service-name]`
- `make up` when you refresh the product (it will re-build and run `docker compose up -d`)

<Callout type="info">
  Take the time to become a bit familiar with docker-compose if it's your first
  use.
</Callout>

## Monitoring

### View Logs

To display the logs of the container:

```bash title="View service logs"
docker compose logs [service-name]
```

<Callout type="info">
  Without service-name, you get all logs. Two options are often used: - `-f` to
  follow output - `--tail n` to only display last n lines
</Callout>

To display all running services, run:

```bash title="Check service status"
make status
```

Example output:

```bash title="Service Status Output"
        Name                      Command               State                  Ports
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
robotoff_api_1         /bin/sh -c /docker-entrypo ...   Up      0.0.0.0:5500->5500/tcp,:::5500->5500
                                                                /tcp
robotoff_postgres_1    docker-entrypoint.sh postg ...   Up      127.0.0.1:5432->5432/tcp
robotoff_scheduler_1   /bin/sh -c /docker-entrypo ...   Up
robotoff_worker_low_1     /bin/sh -c /docker-entrypo ...   Up
robotoff_worker_high_1     /bin/sh -c /docker-entrypo ...   Up
```

### Monitor Task Queues

If you want to monitor how many jobs robotoff has to do (how behind it is), you can run the `rq` command to get status:

```bash title="Check queue status"
docker compose run --rm --no-deps worker_1 rq info
```

<Callout type="info">
  This may help you understand why robotoff insights are not visible immediately
  on products. See also [rq monitoring
  documentation](https://python-rq.org/docs/monitoring/) for more commands and
  information.
</Callout>

## Database Backup and Restore

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Backup PostgreSQL Database
    
    To backup the PostgreSQL database, run the following command:

    ```bash title="Backup PostgreSQL database"
    docker exec -i robotoff_postgres_1 pg_dump --schema public -F c -U postgres postgres | gzip > robotoff_postgres_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).dump
    ```

    <Callout type="warn">
      All Robotoff PostgreSQL dumps are stored on _openfoodfacts.org_ server, in `/srv2/off/html/data/dumps` folder. When backing up the database, please update the `robotoff_postgres_latest.dump` symlink so that http://openfoodfacts.org/data/dumps/robotoff_postgres_latest.dump always points to the latest dump.
    </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Restore Database
    
    You can restore it easily by copying the dump file inside the container and launching `pg_restore`:

    ```bash title="Restore PostgreSQL database"
    docker cp -a robotoff_postgres.dump robotoff_postgres_1:/tmp/
    docker exec -it robotoff_postgres_1 pg_restore -v -d postgres -U postgres -j 8 --if-exists /tmp/robotoff_postgres.dump
    ```

  </Step>
