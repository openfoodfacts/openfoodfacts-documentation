<Callout title="Critical Importance">
  Knowing the category of each product is critically important at Open Food
  Facts, as category is used to compute Nutriscore, to assess the environmental
  impact of the product (thanks to Agribalyse database), to compare the product
  to similar ones,...
</Callout>

## Overview

In Open Food Facts, more **12,500 categories** exist in the [category taxonomy](https://static.openfoodfacts.org/data/taxonomies/categories.full.json) (as of March 2023). Category prediction using product meta-data was one the first project developed as part of Robotoff in 2018.

## Model Architecture

The neural network model [^neural] takes multiple optional inputs:

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Product Name"
    description="The product_name field for text-based classification"
  />
  <Card
    title="Ingredient List"
    description="The ingredients field - only depth one ingredients (sub-ingredients ignored)"
  />
  <Card
    title="OCR Ingredients"
    description="Ingredients extracted from OCR texts using flashtext library"
  />
  <Card
    title="Nutriments"
    description="Common nutrients: salt, proteins, fats, saturated fats, carbohydrates, energy"
  />
  <Card
    title="Images"
    description="Up to 10 most recent images processed with CLIP embeddings"
  />
</Cards>

### Image Processing

<Steps>
<Step>
### Embedding Generation
We generate an embedding for each image using [clip-vit-base-patch32](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff-models/releases/tag/clip-vit-base-patch32) model.
</Step>

<Step>
### Vector Aggregation
Generate a single vector using a multi-head attention layer + GlobalAveragePooling1d.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Ingredient Extraction

<Callout type="info" title="OCR Processing">
  The ingredients extracted from OCR texts: all OCR results are fetched and
  ingredients present in the taxonomy are detected using [flashtext
  library](https://flashtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
</Callout>

## Model Scope

<Callout title="Category Selection">
  The model was trained to predict a subset of all categories: - Broad
  categories (such as plant based foods and beverages) were discarded to keep
  only the most informative categories - Categories with less than 10 products
  were ignored - The model can predict categories for about **3,500 categories**
  of the taxonomy
</Callout>

## Prediction Enhancement

For each predicted category, we also fetch the prediction score of parents, children and siblings (node with the same parents) categories in the taxonomy.

<Callout type="info" title="Future Use">
  This will be used soon to display predictions about neighbor categories and
  select a more (or less) specific category on Hunger Games if needed.
</Callout>

## High-Confidence Predictions

We [computed for each category](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff-models/releases/download/keras-category-classifier-image-embeddings-3.0/threshold_report_0.99.json) the detection threshold above which we have a **precision >= 0.99** on the split obtained from merging validation and test sets.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Threshold-Based Selection
For these predictions, we have a very high confidence that the predicted category is correct.
</Step>

<Step>
  ### Insight Generation We always generate insights from these *above-threshold
  predictions* (except if the category is already filled in for the product),
  and the `v3_categorizer_automatic_processing` campaign is added to the
  insight.
</Step>

<Step>
### Validation Process
The Hunger Game annotation campaign can be [accessed here](https://hunger.openfoodfacts.org/questions?type=category&campaign=v3_categorizer_automatic_processing).
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="success" title="Automatic Processing Goal">
  If the experiment is successful (precision >= 0.99 on Hunger Games questions),
  we will turn on automatic categorization on *above-threshold predictions*.
</Callout>

## Changelog

<Callout title="Evolution Timeline">
  Here is a summary on the milestones in category detection:
</Callout>

- **2018-12** | Deployment of the first "matching" categorizer based on Elasticsearch
- **2019-02** | Deployment of the first hierarchical category classifier using scikit-learn
- **2019-11** | Deployment of the [first neural model (v1)](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff-models/releases/tag/keras-category-classifier-xx-1.0) for product categorization, hierarchical classification was disabled
- **2021-12** | Deployment of the [v2 model](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff-models/releases/tag/keras-category-classifier-xx-2.0)
- **2022-01** | Automatic processing of all category predictions with `score >= 0.9`
- **2022-03** | [Disable automatic processing of categories](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff/issues/636)
- **2022-10** | Remove Elasticsearch-based category predictor, switch to custom model in Robotoff codebase
- **2023-03** | Deployment of the [v3 model](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff-models/releases/tag/keras-category-classifier-image-embeddings-3.0)
- **2023-08** | Disabling of the `matcher` predictor: after an analysis through Hunger Games, most errors were due to the `matcher` predictor, and the `neural` predictor gave most of the time accurate predictions for products for which the `matcher` predictor failed
