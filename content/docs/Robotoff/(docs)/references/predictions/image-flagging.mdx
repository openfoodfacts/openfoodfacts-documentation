# Image Flagging System

The image flagging system automatically identifies inappropriate or problematic content in product images to help maintain Open Food Facts' image quality standards.

## How It Works

Image flagging uses multiple detection methods to identify content that may not be appropriate for a food database:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Face Detection" description="Uses Google Cloud Vision's Face Detection API to identify images containing human faces" />
  <Card title="Label Annotation" description="Scans for labels indicating the presence of humans, pets, electronics, or other non-food items" />
  <Card title="Safe Search" description="Uses Google Cloud Vision's Safe Search API to detect adult content or violence" />
  <Card title="Text Detection" description="Analyzes OCR text for keywords related to beauty products or other inappropriate content" />
</Cards>

<Callout type="info">
  When flagged content is detected, an `image_flag` prediction is generated with details about the issue and the associated confidence level. These predictions trigger notifications to moderation services where humans can review potentially problematic images.
</Callout>

## Detection Methods

### Face Detection

The system processes `faceAnnotations` from Google Cloud Vision to detect human faces. If multiple faces are detected, the one with the highest confidence score is used. 

<Callout type="info">
  Only faces with a detection confidence ≥ 0.6 are flagged to minimize false positives.
</Callout>

**Prediction data includes:**
- `type`: "face_annotation"
- `label`: "face"
- `likelihood`: Detection confidence score

### Label Annotation Detection

The system flags images containing specific labels from Google Cloud Vision with confidence scores ≥ 0.6. Only the first matching label is flagged per image.

#### Human-related Labels

<Cards>
  <Card title="Facial Features" description="Face, Head, Selfie, Hair, Forehead, Chin, Cheek, Eyebrow, Ear, Neck, Jaw, Nose" />
  <Card title="Body Parts" description="Arm, Tooth, Human Leg, Ankle" />
  <Card title="Expressions & Accessories" description="Facial Expression, Glasses, Eyewear" />
  <Card title="Age Groups" description="Child, Baby, Human" />
</Cards>

#### Other Flagged Categories

<Cards>
  <Card title="Pets" description="Dog, Cat" />
  <Card title="Technology" description="Computer, Laptop, Refrigerator" />
  <Card title="Clothing" description="Jeans, Shoe" />
</Cards>

**Prediction data includes:**
- `type`: "label_annotation"
- `label`: The detected label (lowercase)
- `likelihood`: Label confidence score

### Safe Search Detection

The Safe Search API flags the following categories only if marked as "VERY_LIKELY":

<Cards>
  <Card title="Adult Content" description="Sexually explicit material" />
  <Card title="Violence" description="Graphic or violent imagery" />
</Cards>

**Prediction data includes:**
- `type`: "safe_search_annotation"
- `label`: "adult" or "violence"
- `likelihood`: Likelihood level name

### Text-based Detection

The system scans OCR-extracted text for keywords from predefined keyword files. Only the first matching keyword is flagged per image.

<Cards>
  <Card title="Beauty Products" description="Cosmetic-related terms from beauty keyword file" />
  <Card title="Miscellaneous" description="Other inappropriate content keywords from miscellaneous keyword file" />
</Cards>

**Prediction data includes:**
- `type`: "text"
- `label`: "beauty" or "miscellaneous"
- `text`: The matched text phrase

<Callout type="warn">
  **Detection Priority**: The system only flags the first matching criteria per image to avoid duplicate flagging.
</Callout>
