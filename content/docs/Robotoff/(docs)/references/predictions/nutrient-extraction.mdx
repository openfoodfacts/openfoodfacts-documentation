We developed a ML model to automatically extract nutrition information from photos of product packaging where nutrition facts are displayed.

<Callout title="Key Features">
  This model detects the most common nutrition values (proteins, salt,
  energy-kj,...), either for 100g or per serving using the LayoutLMv3
  architecture for Document AI tasks.
</Callout>

## Architecture Overview

The model uses **LayoutLMv3**, an architecture used in Document AI to perform various tasks on structured documents (bills, receipts, reports,...). The model expects three inputs:

- **Input image**: The product packaging photo
- **Tokens**: The words extracted from OCR
- **Spatial positions**: The location of each token on the image

<Callout type="info" title="OCR Requirement">
  As the model requires token text and position as input, an OCR must be
  performed beforehand. We use Google Cloud Vision to extract text content from
  the image.
</Callout>

### Token Classification

LayoutLMv3 architecture can perform several tasks, we frame the problem as a **token classification task**. The model must predict the class of each token, among a predefined set of classes. We follow the IOB format for entity classes.

<Callout title="Complete Token Classes">
  Here is a complete list of the token classes detected by the model:

Nutrients that are not in this list are detected as `O` [^other_nutrient_detection].

## Dataset

Random images selected as nutrition images were picked for annotation. Using the list of labels above, more than **3500 images** were manually annotated.

## Robotoff Integration

### Pre-processing, Inference and Post-processing

The model was exported to **ONNX** and is served by **Triton server**. The model integration in Robotoff can be found in `robotoff.prediction.nutrition_extraction` module.

<Callout title="Core Function">
  The `predict` function [^predict_function] takes as input: - The image (as a
  Pillow Image) - The Google Cloud Vision OCR result (as a `OCRResult` object)
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
### Extract Words and Coordinates
Extract the words and their coordinates from the OCR result.
</Step>

<Step>
  ### Preprocess Data Preprocess the image, the words and their coordinates
  using the LayoutLMv3 preprocessor, that takes care of preprocessing the data
  in the right format for the LayoutLMv3 model.
</Step>

<Step>
  ### Perform Inference The request is sent to Triton server through gRPC to get
  model predictions.
</Step>

<Step>
### Post-process Results
Apply comprehensive post-processing to clean and structure the results.
</Step>
</Steps>

#### Post-processing Steps

<Steps>
<Step>
### Gather Pre-entities
Gather pre-entities from individual labels. There is one pre-entity for each input token.
</Step>

<Step>
  ### Aggregate Entities The 'O' (OTHER) entity is ignored, and pre-entities
  with the same entity class are merged together.
</Step>

<Step>
### Post-process Entities
We post-process the detected text to correct some known limitations of the model, and we extract the value (ex: `5`) and the unit (ex: `g`) from the entity text.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Return Format

The `predict` function returns a `NutritionExtractionPrediction` dataclass with two main fields:

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="nutrients"
    description="Contains postprocessed entities that were considered valid during post-processing (the valid field is therefore not present)"
  />
  <Card
    title="entities"
    description="Contains the raw pre-entities, the aggregated entities and the post-processed entities (respectively in the raw, aggregated and postprocessed fields). Useful for debugging and understanding model predictions."
  />
</Cards>

#### Postprocessed Entity Fields

<Callout title="Entity Structure">
  Postprocessed entities contain the following fields:
</Callout>

- **`entity`**: the nutrient name, in Product Opener format (ex: `energy-kcal_100g` or `salt_serving`)
- **`text`**: the text of the entity (ex: `125 kJ`)
- **`value`**: the nutrient value. It's either a number or `traces`
- **`unit`**: the nutrient unit, either `g`, `mg`, `µg`, `kj`, `kcal` or `null`
- **`score`**: The entity score. We use the score of the first pre-entity as the aggregated entity score
- **`start`**: the word start index of the entity, with respect to the original OCR JSON
- **`end`**: the word end index of the entity, with respect to the original OCR JSON
- **`char_start`**: the character start index of the entity, with respect to the original OCR JSON
- **`char_end`**: the character end index of the entity, with respect to the original OCR JSON
- **`valid`**: whether the extracted entity is valid

<Callout type="warn" title="Unit Handling">
  Sometimes the nutrient unit is not present after the value, or the OCR didn't
  detect the corresponding word. You can either infer a plausible unit given the
  entity (ex: `g` for proteins, carbohydrates,...) or ignore this entity.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Entity Validation">
  We consider an entity invalid if we couldn't extract nutrient value from the
  `text` field, or if there are more than one entity for a single nutrient. For
  example, two `proteins_100g` and one `proteins_serving` are considered valid,
  but two `proteins_100g` are not.
</Callout>

### Integration Workflow

<Steps>
<Step>
### Image Processing
For every new uploaded image, the model is run on this image [^extract_nutrition_job]. As for all computer vision models, we save the model prediction in the `image_prediction` table.
</Step>

<Step>
  ### Prediction Creation If some entities were detected, we create a
  `Prediction` in DB using the usual import mechanism [^import_mechanism], under
  the type `nutrient_extraction`.
</Step>

<Step>
### Insight Generation
We only create an insight if we detected at least one nutrient value that is not in the product nutrients [^nutrient_extraction_import].
</Step>
</Steps>

[^other_nutrient_detection]: Using a fixed set of classes is not the best approach when we have many classes. It however allows us to use LayoutLM architecture, which is very performant for this task, even when the nutrition table is hard to read due to packaging deformations or alterations. To detect the long-tail of nutrients, approaches using graph-based approach, where we would map a nutrient mention to its value, could be explored in the future.
