<Callout type="info">
  This guide covers the complete installation process for Search-a-licious, from
  prerequisites to launching the application.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure mmap Count (Linux Only)">

<Callout type="warning">
**Linux Users Only**

If you are on Linux, you need to make sure that your [system mmap count is high enough for Elasticsearch to run](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html).

</Callout>

Run the following command:

```bash title="Set mmap Count"
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```

**Make it Permanent:**

To make the change permanent, add `vm.max_map_count=262144` to the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file and run:

```bash title="Apply sysctl Changes"
sudo sysctl -p
```

<Callout type="info">
  This ensures that the modified value is retained even after a system reboot.
  Without this step, the value will reset to its default after reboot.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step title="Install Docker and Docker Compose">

<Callout>
  Search-a-licious uses Docker and Docker Compose to manage the services it
  needs to run.

Once both are installed, clone the git repository locally.

## Configuration

<Callout type="info">
  All configuration is passed through environment variables to services using a
  `.env` file. A sample `.env` file is provided in the repository.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step title="Required Configuration">

**Essential Change:** Set the `CONFIG_PATH` variable to the path of your YAML configuration file. This file configures the search-a-licious indexer and search services.

</Step>
<Step title="Production Settings">

<Callout type="warning">
**Production Requirements**

You must configure these settings for production deployment:

    title="COMPOSE_FILE"

  />
</Cards>

<Callout type="info">
  Monitor is optional but recommended for production deployments.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step title="Docker Images">

You can either:

**Option 1: Rebuild locally**

```bash title="Build Docker Images"
make build
```

**Option 2: Use GitHub images**

Edit the `.env` file and set `TAG` to the commit SHA corresponding to the version you want to use.

## Launching the Application

<Callout type="info">
  You should now be able to start the Docker services:
</Callout>

```bash title="Start Docker Services"
docker compose up -d
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Common Issues**

- **Permission Error**: If your user is not part of the `docker` group, you should either [add it](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user) or modify the Makefile to prefix `sudo` to all docker and docker compose commands.

- **Update Container Crashes**: If you are not connected to Redis, Search-a-licious will still run. You need to connect to Redis only if you want continuous updates.
