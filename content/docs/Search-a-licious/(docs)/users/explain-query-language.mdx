The idea of Search-a-licious is to provide a powerful yet easy to use API, through the use of a well proven language: Lucene Query Language.

## Enhanced Query Language

While Elasticsearch provides a way to use this language in the queries, it has some important limitations like the lack of support for nested and object fields.

<Card title="Luqum Library" href="https://github.com/jurismarches/luqum">
  Thanks to the luqum library, Search-a-licious is able to use Lucene Query
  Language in a broader way.
</Card>

Search-a-licious also uses luqum to introspect the query and transform it to add features corresponding to your configuration and leverage taxonomies and other peculiarities.

<Callout type="info">
  It enables for example taking into account synonyms, or adding the languages
  to query about on the fly without the need to complexify the query too much at
  API level.
</Callout>

## Query Syntax

The query syntax is quite simple, you have several options:

<Steps>
<Step title="Simple Word Search">

Query for simple word in the default text fields (those having `full_text_search` property in your configuration) by simply having the word in your query:

```sh title="Simple Word Query"
chocolate
```

Entries with text `chocolate`

</Step>
<Step title="Exact Phrase Search">

Match exactly a full sentence by using quotes:

```sh title="Exact Phrase Query"
"dark chocolate"
```

Entries with text `dark chocolate`

</Step>
<Step title="Field-Specific Search">

Match a word or phrase in a specific field by using the field name, followed by a colon:

```sh title="Field-Specific Query"
labels:organic
```

Entries with labels containing `organic`

</Step>
<Step title="Multiple Terms">

Have more than one term, the query will try to match all terms:

```sh title="Multiple Terms Query"
"dark chocolate" labels:organic
```

Entries with text `dark chocolate` and labels containing `organic`

</Step>
<Step title="Complex Queries with Operators">

Combine queries with `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` operators, and use parentheses to group them:

```sh title="Complex Query with Operators"
"dark chocolate" AND (labels:organic OR labels:vegan) AND NOT nutriscore:(e OR d)
```

Entries with text `dark chocolate`, labels containing `organic` or `vegan`, and Nutri-Score not `e` or `d`

</Step>
<Step title="Sub-field Queries">

Query a sub field by using "." or ":":

```sh title="Sub-field Query Example 1"
nutrients.sugar_100g:[10 TO 15]
```

Equivalent to:

```sh title="Sub-field Query Example 2"
nutrients:sugar_100g:[10 TO 15]
```

Entries with sugar between 10 and 15 grams per 100g

</Step>
<Step title="Unbounded Range Queries">

In ranges you can use \* for unbounded values:

```sh title="Unbounded Range Query"
nutrients.sugar_100g:[* TO 20] AND nutrients.proteins_100g:[2 TO *]
```

Entries with sugar below 20g and proteins above 2g for 100g

</Step>
<Step title="Field Existence Check">

Match field existence with `*`:

```sh title="Field Existence Query"
nutriscore:*
```

Entries with Nutri-Score computed

</Step>
</Steps>

## Different Types of Fields

When you created your configuration, you defined different field types. It's important because the matching possibilities are not the same.
