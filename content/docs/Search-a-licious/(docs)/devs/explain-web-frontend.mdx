# Explain Web Frontend

<Callout type="info">
  The search-a-licious web frontend supplies web components built using
  [Lit](https://lit.dev) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
</Callout>

## Code Structure Overview

<Callout>
  We use web-components because they enable integration in a very wide variety
  of situations.
</Callout>

### Core Components

  />
</Cards>

### Architecture Details

<Steps>
<Step title="Search Controller">

The `search-ctl.ts` file contains the search controller, which is responsible for launching search and dispatching results. In practice this is a mixin, used by the search bar components which gets this role of controller. It is the contact point with the API.

The controller has a specific name, and components that are linked to it refer to the search bar name (`search-name` property). The default is 'searchalicious'.

</Step>
<Step title="Event System">

Components communicate with the search controller through events (see `events.ts`).

**Event Types:**

- Event to launch a search or change page
- Event to dispatch search results

<Callout type="info">
  Events always contain the search name, so we could have more than one search
  on the same page.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step title="Code Reusability">

We factor code when it makes sense using mixins. For example, since there are lots of components that need the search results, there is a mixin that contains the logic to register to such events (see `search-results-ctl.ts`).

</Step>
</Steps>

## Writing Documentation

<Callout type="info">
  We render the reference on web components using
  [`api-viewer`](https://api-viewer.open-wc.org/docs) web component.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Documentation Requirements**

Please comply with JSDoc and [document every property / slots](https://api-viewer.open-wc.org/docs/guide/writing-jsdoc/) etc. on each web component.

</Callout>

## Development Tools

<Callout type="info">
  Thanks to the Makefile in root folder, you have access to various development
  commands:
</Callout>

  <Card title="make lint_front" description="Lint JavaScript code" />
  <Card
    title="make tsc_watch"
    description="Compile TypeScript on file save (recommended while coding)"
  />
</Cards>

### Documentation Generation

<Steps>
<Step title="Custom Elements Manifest">

We generate a [custom-elements.json manifest](https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest) using [custom elements manifest analyzer](https://custom-elements-manifest.open-wc.org/analyzer).

</Step>
<Step title="JSDoc Documentation">

<Card
  title="JSDoc Markers"
  href="https://custom-elements-manifest.open-wc.org/analyzer/getting-started/#supported-jsdoc"
>
  Please use supported JSDoc markers in your code to document components
</Card>

</Step>
<Step title="Component Documentation">

The components documentation is rendered in `web-components.html`, using the [api-viewer component](https://api-viewer.open-wc.org/)

</Step>
</Steps>

## Testing

<Callout>Run frontend tests with the following command:</Callout>

```bash title="Run Frontend Tests"
make test_front
```

</Cards>

## Translations

<Callout type="info">
  In the frontend, we utilize
  [lit-localize](https://lit.dev/docs/localization/overview/), a library that
  leverages lit-element for managing translations from hardcoded text.
</Callout>

### Language Configuration

- **Language Detection**: Set to the browser's language if supported by the project
- **Fallback**: Default language is English
- **Storage**: Translations are stored in `xliff` files in the `frontend/xliff` directory

### Adding New Translations

<Steps>
<Step title="Add Message Tags">

Add `msg` in your code like this: [Message Types Documentation](https://lit.dev/docs/localization/overview/#message-types)

</Step>
<Step title="Extract Translations">

```bash title="Extract New Translations"
npm run translations:extract
```

</Step>
<Step title="Add Target Translations">

Add your translation with 'target' tag in the `xliff/<your_language>.xlf` files

</Step>
<Step title="Build Translations">

```bash title="Build Translation Files"
npm run translations:build
```

This updates the translations in the `src/generated/locales/<your_language>.js` file

</Step>
</Steps>

### Adding New Languages

<Callout type="info">
  To add a language, add the language code to `targetLocales` in
  `lit-localize.json`
</Callout>

### Crowdin Integration

<Card
  title="Crowdin Translation Management"
  href="https://store.crowdin.com/xliff"
>
  We can use Crowdin to manage translations. All files in the xliff/ folder can
  be uploaded to Crowdin, as it supports the xlf format.
