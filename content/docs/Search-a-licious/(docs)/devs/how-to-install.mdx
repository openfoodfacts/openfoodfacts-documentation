<Callout type="info">
  This guide will help you set up your local development environment for
  Search-a-licious.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisites">

First, follow the same [prerequisites as for normal installation](../users/how-to-install#prerequisites):

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="mmap Count"
    description="Configure system mmap count for Elasticsearch"
  />
  <Card title="Docker Setup" description="Install Docker and Docker Compose" />
</Cards>

</Step>
<Step title="Install Development Tools">

### Pre-commit

<Callout>We use pre-commit to check the code quality.</Callout>

<Card title="Pre-commit Installation" href="https://pre-commit.com/#install">
  Follow the official tutorial to install pre-commit on your machine
</Card>

### Direnv

<Callout type="info">
  Direnv is a tool to automatically set environment variables depending on the
  current directory. This is handy to personalize the environment for each
  project as environment variables have priority over the `.env` file.
</Callout>

<Card
  title="Direnv Tutorial"
  href="https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-server/dev/how-to-use-direnv/"
>
  For Linux and macOS users, follow our tutorial to install direnv^[winEnvrc]
</Card>

</Step>
<Step title="Environment Setup">

<Callout type="info">
**Environment Configuration Options**

You have several options to set up your environment:

1. Use direnv with the `.envrc` file (recommended)
2. Add a `.envrc` that you source in your terminal (recommended)
3. Modify the `.env` file directly (not recommended for development)
   </Callout>

The following steps are for the recommended options. If you edit the `.env` directly, ignore the "export " keywords.

**Get your user information:**

```bash title="Get User IDs"
id -u  # for USER_UID
id -g  # for USER_GID
```

**Create `.envrc` file:**

Add a `.envrc` file at the root of the project:

```bash title="Environment Configuration"
export USER_GID=<your_user_gid>
export USER_UID=<your_user_uid>

export CONFIG_PATH=data/config/openfoodfacts.yml
export OFF_API_URL=https://world.openfoodfacts.org
export ALLOWED_ORIGINS='http://localhost,http://127.0.0.1'
```

<Callout type="info">
  ^[winEnvrc]: For Windows users, the .envrc is only taken into account by the
  `make` commands.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step title="Build Containers">

To build the containers, run the following command:

```bash title="Build Development Containers"
make build
```

Note: the Makefile will align the user id with your own uid for a smooth editing experience (having same user id in container and host, so that you have permission to edit files).

## Running

Now you can run the project with Docker `docker compose up `.

After that run the following command on another shell to compile the project:

```bash title="Watch TypeScript Compilation"
make tsc_watch
```

<Callout type="info">
  Do this for next installation steps and to run the project.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Common Issues**

- **Permission Error**: If your user is not part of the `docker` group, you should either [add it](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user) or modify the Makefile to prefix `sudo` to all docker and docker compose commands.
- **Update Container Crash**: Container crashes because we are not connected to Redis, this is not a problem for development.
  </Callout>

</Step>
<Step title="Verify Installation">

Docker spins up several services:

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Elasticsearch"
    description="Two nodes, one exposed on port 9200 - test at http://127.0.0.1:9200"
  />
  <Card
    title="Elasticvue"
    description="Management UI on port 8080 - test at http://127.0.0.1:8080"
  />
  <Card title="Search Service" description="API and UI on port 8000" />
</Cards>

**Test the services:**

- API: http://search.localhost:8000/docs
- UI: http://search.localhost:8000/

<Callout type="info">
  By default we only expose on the localhost interface. This is driven by the
  `*_EXPOSE` variables in `.env`.
</Callout>

**Congratulations, you have successfully installed the project!**

</Step>
<Step title="Import Development Data">

You will need to import data from a JSONL dump:

**Import Taxonomies:**

```bash title="Import Taxonomies"
make import-taxonomies
```

**Import Products:**

```bash title="Import Sample Products"
# Get some sample data
curl https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data/exports/products.random-modulo-10000.jsonl.gz --output data/products.random-modulo-10000.jsonl.gz
gzip -d data/products.random-modulo-10000.jsonl.gz

# Import data (skip updates because we're not connected to Redis)
make import-dataset filepath='products.random-modulo-10000.jsonl' args='--skip-updates'
```

**Verify your data:** Visit http://search.localhost:8000/

</Step>
<Step title="Explore Data">

<Callout>
  When you need to explore the Elasticsearch data, you can use Elasticvue.
</Callout>

1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/welcome
2. Click on "Add Elasticsearch cluster"
3. Change the cluster name to "docker-cluster" at http://127.0.0.1:9200
4. Click on "Connect"

</Step>
