**Multi-Project Ecosystem**

Open Beauty Facts, Open Pet Food Facts, Open Products Facts behave mostly like Open Food Facts. Behaviours may change over time, as we tweak it.

## Important APIs for Universal Product Scanning

### Universal Barcode API

<Callout>
**Universal Scanning Solution**

We have a universal barcode scanning API, where you scan a barcode, and you get a result from either Open Food Facts, Open Pet Food Facts, Open Beauty Facts or Open Products Facts with a `product_type`.

</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
**Use Universal Parameter**

You can use the `product_type=all` parameter

</Step>

<Step>
**Automatic Redirection**

Asked on any instance, it will redirect you to the right instance if a product exists and is on another instance (eg: asking for a beauty barcode on food instance)

</Step>

<Step>
**API Reference**

<Card title="Universal Barcode API Documentation" href="https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-server/api/ref-v2/#get-/api/v2/product/-barcode-">
See reference documentation for complete implementation details
</Card>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Handling Missing Products

<Callout type="info">
**Missing Product Flow**

If no result is found in any of the 4 databases, you will have to ask the type of product to your users, and use the classic product addition API on the right project.

</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
**Wrong Project Detection**

If (it can happen) the product appears on the wrong project, we suggest you use the NutriPatrol API to let your users report it to the moderators

</Step>

<Step>
**Proceed with Correct Addition**

Then proceed to a product addition on the right project

</Step>

<Step>
**Moderation Process**

The moderators will then move the existing data to the right project

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout>
**Future Goal**

Eventually, project categorization errors should be infinitesimal

</Callout>

## API Roadmap and multi-project behaviour

We plan to bring the APIs mentioned above to Open Beauty Facts (Search-a-licious, Knowledge Panels, Open Prices, Robotoff, Folksonomy Engine)

## Sample outputs

Please use the Open Food Facts API reference for most operations (data and photo addition, ingredient lists, categories, labels…)

### Ingredients

<Callout type="warning">
  **Experimental Feature**

This is very experimental. Do not rely on this for allergen or ingredient parsing yet.
