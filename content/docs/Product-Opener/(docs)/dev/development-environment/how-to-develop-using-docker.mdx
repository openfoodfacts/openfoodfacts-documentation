## Checking logs

<Tabs items={['Tail Docker Compose logs', 'Tail other logs']}>
<Tab value="Tail Docker Compose logs">

```bash title="View All Container Logs"
make log
```

<Callout>
**What You'll See**

You will get logs from nginx, mongodb, postgres, etc.

</Callout>

</Tab>
<Tab value="Tail other logs">

<Callout type="info">
**Perl Logs Location**

Most logs from perl are not (yet?) displayed on the docker logs, but are instead available in specific directories.

</Callout>

```bash title="View Perl Application Logs"
make tail
```

<Callout>
**Log Files Available**

This will `tail -f` all the files present in the `logs/` directory:

- `apache2/error.log`
- `apache2/log4perl.log`
- `apache2/modperl_error.log`
- `apache2/other_vhosts_access.log`
- `nginx/access.log`
- `nginx/error.log`
  </Callout>

You can also simply run:

```bash title="View Specific Log File"
tail -f <FILEPATH>
```

<Callout type="warn">
**Most Important Log**

One of the most important is `log4perl.log`.

</Callout>

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Increasing log verbosity

<Callout type="info">
**Default Configuration**

By default, the `log4perl` configuration `conf/log.conf` matches production settings. You can tweak that file with your own dev configuration settings and run `make restart` to reload the changes.

</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
**Edit Log Configuration**

A setting useful for local environments is to set `TRACE` log level:

```ini title="Enable TRACE Logging"
log4perl.rootLogger=TRACE, LOGFILE
```

</Step>

<Step>
**Restart Services**

```bash title="Apply Changes"
make restart
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Opening a shell in a Docker container

```bash title="Access Backend Container"
docker compose exec backend bash
```

<Callout>
**Container Shell Access**

You should see `root@<CONTAINER_ID>:/#` (opened root shell): you are now within the Docker container and can begin typing some commands!

</Callout>

### Checking permissions

Navigate to the specific directory and run

```bash title="List Directory Permissions"
ls -lrt
```

<Callout>
**What This Does**

It will list all directories and their permissions.

</Callout>

### Creating directory

Navigate to your specific directory using `cd` and run

```bash
mkdir directory-name
```

### Running minion jobs

[Minion](https://docs.mojolicious.org/Minion) is a high-performance job queue for Perl, used in [openfoodfacts-server](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server) for time-consuming import and export tasks. These tasks are processed and queued using the minion jobs queue. Therefore, they are called minion jobs.

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Minion Job Status">
Go to `/opt/product-opener/scripts` and run

```bash
./minion_producers.pl minion job
```

The above command will show the status of minion jobs.

</Step>
<Step title="Launch Minion Jobs">
Run the following command to launch the minion jobs.

```bash
./minion_producers.pl minion worker -m production -q pro.openfoodfacts.org
```

</Step>
</Steps>

### Restarting Apache

Sometimes restarting the whole `backend` container is overkill, and you can just
restart `Apache` from inside the container:

```bash
apache2ctl -k restart
```

### Exiting the container

Use `exit` to exit the container.

## Making code changes

In the dev environment, any code change to the local directory will be written
to the container. That said, some code changes require a restart of the `backend`
container, or rebuilding the NPM assets.

## Getting away from make up

`make up` is a good command for starters,
but it's not the right one to use if you develop on a daily basis, because it may be slow,
as it does a full rebuild, which, in dev mode, should only be necessary in a few cases.

On a daily basis you could better run those:

- `docker compose up` to start and monitor the stack.
- `docker compose restart backend` to account for a code change in a `.pm` file
  (cgi `pl` files do not need a restart)
- `docker compose stop` to stop them all

If some important file changed (like Dockerfile or cpanfile, etc.), or if in doubt,
you can run `docker compose build` (or maybe it's a good time to use `make up` once)

You should explore the [docker compose commands](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/).
Most are useful!

### Live reload

To automate the live reload on code changes, you can install the Python package `when-changed`:

```bash
pip3 install when-changed
when-changed -r docker/ docker-compose.yml .env -c "make restart"                                         # restart backend container on compose changes
when-changed -r lib/ -r docker/ docker-compose.yml -c "docker compose backend restart" # restart Apache on code changes
when-changed -r html/ Dockerfile Dockerfile.frontend package.json -c "make up" # rebuild containers on asset or Dockerfile changes
```

An alternative to `when-changed` is `inotifywait`.

## Run queries on MongoDB database

```bash
docker compose exec mongodb mongo
```

The above command will open a MongoDB shell, allowing you to use all the `mongo`
commands to interact with the database:

```bash
show dbs
use off
db.products.count()
db.products.find({_id: "5053990155354"})
db.products.deleteOne({_id: "5053990155354"})
```

See the [`mongo` shell docs](https://www.mongodb.com/products/shell) for more commands.

## Adding environment variables

If you need some value to be configurable, it is best to set it as an environment variable.

<Steps>
<Step title="Add to .env file">
In a `.env` file, add `TEST=test_val` [local].
</Step>
<Step title="Add to GitHub Workflow">
In `.github/workflows/container-deploy.yml`, add `echo "TEST=${{ secrets.TEST }}" >> .env` to the "Set environment variables" build step [remote]. Also add the corresponding GitHub secret `TEST=test_val`.
</Step>
<Step title="Add to docker-compose.yml">
In `docker-compose.yml` file, add it under the `backend` > `environment` section.
</Step>
<Step title="Add to conf/apache.conf">
In `conf/apache.conf` file, add `PerlPassEnv TEST`.
</Step>
<Step title="Add to lib/Config2.pm">
In `lib/Config2.pm`, add `$test = $ENV{TEST};`. Also add `$test` to the `EXPORT_OK` list at the top of the file to avoid a compilation error.
</Step>
<Step title="Understand the Call Stack">
The call stack goes like this:

`make up` > `docker compose` > loads `.env` > pass env variables to the `backend` container > pass to `mod_perl` > initialized in `Config2.pm`.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Managing multiple deployments

To juggle between multiple local deployments (e.g: to run different flavors of Open Food Facts on the same host),
there are different possible strategies.

<Tabs items={['Using a setenv script', 'Using different .env files']}>
<Tab value="Using a setenv script">

docker compose takes its settings from, in decreasing priority:

- the environment
- the `.env` file

So one strategy to have a different instance,
can be to keep the same `.env` file, but override some env variables to tweak the configuration.
This is a good strategy for the pro platform.

For this case we have a
[`setenv.sh`](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server/blob/main/env/setenv.sh)
script.

To use it, open a terminal, where you want to be in pro environment and simply use:

```bash
. setenv.sh off-pro
```

**Note:** This terminal will remain in `pro` mode until you end its session.

See also [Developing on the producers platform](how-to-develop-producer-platform)

</Tab>
<Tab value="Using different .env files">

This strategy might be the right one if your settings differ a lot.

You will need:

- Multiple `.env` files (one per deployment), such as:
  - `.env.off` : configuration for Open Food Facts dev env.
  - `.env.off-pro` : configuration for Open Food Facts Producer's Platform dev env.
  - `.env.obf`: configuration for Open Beauty Facts dev env.
  - `.env.opff`: configuration for Open Pet Food Facts dev env.

- `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`, `COMPOSE_PROFILES`, `PRODUCT_OPENER_DOMAIN`, `PRODUCT_OPENER_PORT`, `PRODUCT_OPENER_FLAVOR` and `PRODUCT_OPENER_FLAVOR_SHORT` set to different values in each `.env` file, so that container names across deployments are unique and frontend containers don't port-conflict with each other. See example below.

To switch between configurations, set `ENV_FILE` before running `make` commands,
(or `docker compose` command):

```bash
ENV_FILE=.env.off-pro make up # starts the OFF Producer's Platform containers.
ENV_FILE=.env.obf     make up # starts the OBF containers.
ENV_FILE=.env.opff    make up # starts the OPFF containers.
```

or export it to keep it for a while:

```bash
export ENV_FILE=.env.off # going to work on OFF for a while
make up
make restart
make down
make log
```

A good strategy is to have multiple terminals open, one for each deployment:

- `off` [Terminal 1]:

  ```bash
  export ENV_FILE=.env.off
  make up
  ```

- `off-pro` [Terminal 2]:

  ```bash
  export ENV_FILE=.env.off-pro
  make up
  ```

- `obf` [Terminal 3]:

  ```bash
  export ENV_FILE=.env.obf
  make up
  ```

- `opff` [Terminal 3]:
  ```bash
  export ENV_FILE=.env.opff
  make up
  ```

**Note:** the above case of 4 deployments is **_a bit ambitious_**, since ProductOpener's `backend` container takes about ~6GB of RAM to run, meaning that the above 4 deployments would require a total of 24GB of RAM available.

**Example:** if you already have Open Food Facts up and running and you would like to have Open Beauty Facts as well. Then, copy `.env` to `.env.obf` and modify the following variables:

```
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=po_off
COMPOSE_PROFILES=off
PRODUCT_OPENER_DOMAIN=openfoodfacts.localhost
PRODUCT_OPENER_PORT=80
PRODUCT_OPENER_FLAVOR=openfoodfacts
PRODUCT_OPENER_FLAVOR_SHORT=off
```

to

```
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=po_obf
COMPOSE_PROFILES=obf
PRODUCT_OPENER_DOMAIN=openbeautyfacts.localhost
PRODUCT_OPENER_PORT=81
PRODUCT_OPENER_FLAVOR=openbeautyfacts
PRODUCT_OPENER_FLAVOR_SHORT=obf
```

Run:

```bash
export ENV_FILE=.env.obf
make dev
```

If you have error like `Errors in the labels taxonomy definition at /opt/product-opener/lib/ProductOpener/Tags.pm line 1622.`, due to conflict between taxonomies, a small hack is to comment the lines (it appears 2 times in the file) raising error in the **Tags.pm** file.
