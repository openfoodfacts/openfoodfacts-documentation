## Download from Open Food Facts server

All images are hosted under the `https://images.openfoodfacts.org/images/products/` folder.
But you have to build the right URL from the product info.

### Images URL directly available in product data

When you request the API, you will get the url of some important images: front, ingredients, nutrition, packaging. The field [`selected_images`](https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-server/api/ref-v2/#cmp--schemas-product-images) provides you with those images.

The structure should be simple enough to read. You get different image type, and inside different image size, and inside the urls for the different languages.

### Computing images URL

If you want to get an image which url is not directly present in product data, you need to compute the image url by yourself.

#### Computing single product image folder

Images of a product are stored in a single directory. The path of this directory can be inferred easily from the product barcode:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Pad the barcode**: If the barcode is less than 13 digits long, it must be
    padded with leading 0s so that it has 13 digits.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Split the barcode**: Split the first 9 digits of the barcode into 3 groups
    of 3 digits to get the first 3 folder names, and use the rest of the barcode
    as the last folder name. For example, barcode `3435660768163` is split into:
    `343/566/076/8163`.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Construct the URL**: The product images will be in
    `https://images.openfoodfacts.org/images/products/343/566/076/8163`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The following regex can be used to split the barcode into subfolders: `/^(...)(...)(...)(.*)$/`

#### Computing single image file name

Above we get the folder name, now we need the filename inside that folder for a particular image.

<Callout title="Understanding images data">
  To get the image file names, we have to use the database dump or the API. All
  images information are stored in the `images` field.
</Callout>

Eg. For product [3168930010883](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/api/v2/product/3168930010883.json), we have (trimmed the data):

```json title="Images Data Example"
{
  "1": {
    "sizes": {
      "full": { "w": 850, "h": 1200 },
      "100": { "h": 100, "w": 71 },
      "400": { "h": 400, "w": 283 }
    },
    "uploader": "kiliweb",
    "uploaded_t": "1527184614"
  },
  "front_fr": {
    "imgid": "1",
    "rev": "4",
    "sizes": {
      "200": { "w": 142, "h": 200 },
      "full": { "w": 850, "h": 1200 },
      "400": { "h": 400, "w": 283 },
      "100": { "w": 71, "h": 100 }
    }
  }
}
```

The keys of the map are the keys of the images. These keys can be:

- digits: the image is the _raw image_ sent by the contributor (full resolution).
- selected images:
  - `front_{lang}` correspond to the front product image in language with code `lang`
  - `ingredients_{lang}` correspond to the ingredients image in language with code `lang`
  - `nutrition_{lang}` is the same but for nutrition data
  - `packaging_{lang}` for packaging logos

`lang` is a 2-letter ISO 639-1 language code (fr, en, es, …).

Each image is available in different resolutions: `100`, `200`, `400` or `full`, each corresponding to image height (`full` means not resized). The available resolutions can be found in the `sizes` subfield.

<Tabs items={['Filename for a raw image', 'Filename for a selected image']}>
<Tab value="Filename for a raw image">
For a raw image (the one under a numeric key in images field), the filename is very easy to compute:
* just take the image digit + `.jpg` for full resolution
* image digit + `.` + resolution + `.jpg` for a lower resolution

For our example above, the filename for image `"1"`:

- in resolution 400px is `1.400.jpg`
- in full resolution, it is `1.jpg`

So, adding the folder part, the final url for our example is:

- `https://images.openfoodfacts.org/images/products/316/893/001/0883/1.jpg` for the full image
- `https://images.openfoodfacts.org/images/products/316/893/001/0883/1.400.jpg` for the 400px version

</Tab>

  <Tab value="Filename for a selected image">
    In the structure, selected images have additional fields:

      * `rev` (as revision) indicates the revision number of the image to use.
      * `imgid`, the image ID of the raw image used to generate the selected image.

      For selected images, the filename is the image key followed by the revision number and the resolution: `<image_name>.<rev>.<resolution>.jpg`. Resolution must always be specified, but you can use `full` keyword to get the full resolution image. `image_name` is the image type + language code (eg: `front_fr`).

      In our above example, the filename for the front image in french (`front_fr` key) is:

      - `front_fr.4.400.jpg` for 400 px version
      - `front_fr.4.full.jpg` for full resolution version

      So, adding the folder part, the final url for our example is:

      - `https://images.openfoodfacts.org/images/products/316/893/001/0883/front_fr.4.full.jpg` for the full image
      - `https://images.openfoodfacts.org/images/products/316/893/001/0883/front_fr.4.400.jpg` for the 400px version

    </Tab>

</Tabs>

### A python snippet

So if we have the product_data in a dict, Python code for doing it would be something like:

```python title="Image URL Generator Function"
import re

def get_image_url(product_data, image_name, resolution="full"):
    if image_name not in product_data["images"]:
        return None
    base_url = "https://images.openfoodfacts.org/images/products"
    # get product folder name
    folder_name = product_data["code"]
    if len(folder_name) > 8:
        folder_name = re.sub(r'(...)(...)(...)(.*)', r'\1/\2/\3/\4', folder_name)
    # get filename
    if re.match("^\d+$", image_name):  # only digits
        # raw image
        resolution_suffix = "" if resolution == "full" else f".{resolution}"
        filename = f"{image_name}{resolution_suffix}.jpg"
    else:
        # selected image
        rev = product_data["images"][image_name]["rev"]
        filename = f"{image_name}.{rev}.{resolution}.jpg"
    # join things together
    return f"{base_url}/{folder_name}/{filename}"
```
