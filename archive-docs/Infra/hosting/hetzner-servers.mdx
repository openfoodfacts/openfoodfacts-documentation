### Console

You can access the console at [Hetzner Robot](https://robot.hetzner.com).

<Callout type="info">
The Hetzner Robot interface provides comprehensive server management including power controls, rescue system, and network configuration.
</Callout>

### vSwitch

Because some of our servers have only one NIC (Network Interface Card), we need to use a vSwitch to connect our servers in a private network (which is handy for a Proxmox cluster).

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Configure vSwitch**
    
    Set up the vSwitch in Hetzner Robot for private networking.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Connect Servers**
    
    Add servers to the vSwitch to enable private communication.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Configure Proxmox Networking**
    
    Set up cluster networking using the private vSwitch network.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
Check the [Official documentation for vSwitch](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/network/vswitch/) for detailed configuration instructions.
