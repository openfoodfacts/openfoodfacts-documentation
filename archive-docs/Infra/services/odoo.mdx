Odoo serves as Open Food Facts' relationship management tool, accessible at [connect.openfoodfacts.org](https://connect.openfoodfacts.org).

<Callout type="warning">
Odoo is a very rich tool: we need to think carefully before making changes. Some actions cannot be canceled; for example, some modules, when installed, cannot be removed.
</Callout>

## Management Guidelines

<Cards>
  <Card title="Access Control">
    Separate technical and functional admin rights
  </Card>
  <Card title="Planning Required">
    Clear usage requirements and discussion before module installation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Testing First">
    All changes must be tested in staging environment
  </Card>
</Cards>

### Quick Guidelines

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Separate Permissions**
    
    Technical and functional admin rights should be separated.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Document Requirements**
    
    Usages should be clearly expressed and modules should be discussed before implementation. An issue must be opened before each module or group of module installation.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Test Everything**
    
    Tests need to be made in a staging environment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Installation

The current test instance (Odoo 15) has been installed with the following process:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **System Preparation**
    
    ```bash title="Install Base System"
    # Install Debian 11
    apt install postgresql -y
    apt install wkhtmltopdf
    apt install gnupg gnupg1 gnupg2
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>

    echo "deb http://nightly.odoo.com/15.0/nightly/deb/ ./" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/odoo.list
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Install Odoo**
    
    ```bash title="Install Odoo Package"
    apt-get update && apt-get install odoo

    ### Basic Service Control
    
    ```bash title="Service Management Commands"
    sudo systemctl start odoo      # Start service
    sudo systemctl stop odoo       # Stop service
    sudo systemctl restart odoo    # Restart service
    sudo systemctl status odoo     # Check status

    ```bash title="View Logs"
    journalctl -u odoo -f
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="warning">
Always test module installation in a staging environment first. Some modules cannot be uninstalled once installed.
</Callout>

### Installing Modules from Apps Store

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Download Module**
    
    ```bash title="Download and Extract Module"
    cd /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/odoo/addons

  <Step>
    **Restart and Install**
    
    ```bash title="Restart Service"
    systemctl restart odoo
    ```
    
    Then install through Odoo interface as described above.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating Test Environment

<Callout type="info">
This process creates a staging environment from the production instance using Proxmox snapshots.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Prepare Environment**
    
    Verify that CT 112 is currently connect-staging, and delete it before renewal if necessary.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Create and Clone Snapshot**
    
    ```bash title="Clone Production to Staging"
    pct snapshot 110 temp  # Create snapshot of CT 110 (production)
    pct clone 110 112 --hostname connect-staging --snapname temp  # Clone to CT 112
    pct delsnapshot 110 temp  # Delete production snapshot
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Configure New Container**
    
    ```bash title="Configure Staging Container"
    pct set 112 --cores 2 --memory 4096 --net0 name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,gw=10.0.0.1,ip=10.1.0.112/24
    pct start 112
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Post-Configuration**
    
    <Callout type="info">
    Additional configuration steps may be required depending on specific staging requirements.
    </Callout>
    
    ```bash title="Execute Commands on Container"
    # Use this pattern to execute commands on the container from host
    pct exec 112 [command]
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
**Note**: This process is still being documented and may require additional steps for complete staging environment setup.
</Callout>
