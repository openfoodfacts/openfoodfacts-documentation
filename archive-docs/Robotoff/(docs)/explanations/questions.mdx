<Callout title="Client-Server Communication">
  After loading a product, the client (web, iOS, Android) will request the
  Robotoff server a _question_ (on `/api/v1/questions/{barcode}`).
  [^question_api]
</Callout>

A question includes an insight and metadata such that the client knows how to display the question and what kind of input is expected from the user.

<Callout type="info" title="Localization">
  All data returned by Robotoff is localized with respect to the `lang`
  parameter provided by the client.
</Callout>

## Question Formats

<Callout title="Universal Option">
  For all formats, a _I don't know_ button will offer the user the possibility
  to leave without answering the question.
</Callout>

### Addition: Binary Choice (`add-binary`)

Add a fact about a product, by accepting (1) or rejecting (0) the insight.
