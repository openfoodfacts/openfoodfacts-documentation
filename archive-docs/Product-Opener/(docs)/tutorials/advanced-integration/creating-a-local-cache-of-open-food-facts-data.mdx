**Performance Enhancement**

Open Food Facts (OFF) offers a rich dataset of food product information. Creating a local cache can enhance performance for your heavy-duty applications.

</Callout>

## What is a Local Cache?

<Callout type="info">
**Definition**

A local cache is a copy of OFF data stored directly on your system or server. This allows your application to retrieve information without constantly querying the main OFF API, improving speed and reliability.

</Callout>

## Need for Diverse Solutions

<Callout>
**Intensive Operations Support**

We encourage developers who feel the need for very intensive operations not driven by user scans to create local caching solutions in various programming languages. These can be integrated into your own projects, and if well-designed, have the potential to become official OFF backends.

</Callout>

## When NOT to Cache

<Callout type="warn">
**Consider Direct API Usage**

For applications primarily focused on user-generated requests, a local cache may not be necessary. The OFF API can handle many such requests efficiently, and direct API usage contributes to valuable scan statistics for the project.

</Callout>

## Licensing and Data Sharing

<Callout type="warn">
**Legal Compliance Required**

Even when using a local cache, you're still bound by the Open Database License (ODbL). **Do not mix OFF data with external product data**. All additions or modifications made to OFF data must be shared back to OFF, preferably through the WRITE API.

</Callout>

<Card title="Legal Guidelines" href="/docs/Product-Opener/tutorials/compliance-best-practices/license-be-on-the-legal-side">

</Card>

<Callout>
**Integration Recommendation**

Consider incorporating data sharing functionality into your cache implementation.

</Callout>

## Challenges of Cache Maintenance

<Callout type="info">
**Dynamic Data Complexity**

Maintaining a cache can be complex due to the dynamic nature of OFF data.

</Callout>

### Immediate Updates

<Callout>
**Write Process**

Any writes to OFF data should first go through automatic moderation on your end (see our tutorial about this). After successful submission to OFF, your local cache should be immediately refreshed.

</Callout>

### Real-Time Notifications (Future)

<Callout type="info">
**Future Feature**

Currently, there's no public API for real-time OFF updates stream. However, we have an internal system (REDIS) and are exploring options for a future 3rd party notification API.

## Building Your Own Cache

<Steps>
<Step>
**Choose Your Technology**

Select a database or storage mechanism suitable for your language and project needs.

</Step>

<Step>
**Data Structure**

Design a structure to efficiently store product information, categories, ingredients, etc.

</Step>

<Step>
**Synchronization**

Develop processes to regularly fetch updates from the OFF API and refresh your cache.

</Step>

<Step>
**Data Validation**

Implement mechanisms to validate the accuracy and integrity of the cached data.

</Step>

<Step>
**Sharing Back**

Integrate the OFF WRITE API to automatically share any new or modified data.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Get Involved!
