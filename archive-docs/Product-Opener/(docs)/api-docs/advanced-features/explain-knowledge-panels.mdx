**Ready-to-Display Information**

The Open Food Facts API allows clients (such as the Open Food Facts website and mobile app) to request ready-to-display information about an object (such as a product or a facet like a category).
</Callout>

Clients do not have to know in advance what kind of information is displayed (for example - the ingredients of a product, nutrition data, Nutri-Score or Eco-Score). They only have to know how to display essential data types such as texts, grades, images, and tables.

## Main elements

<Callout type="info">
**Panel Structure**

Main elements are panels, which in turn contain elements. Elements are typically `text_element`, `image_element`, `map_element`. Some panels are grouping panels together, forming a hierarchy.
</Callout>

We also have a concept of action, which allows the user to take an action, currently editing.

## How to make a knowledge panel related contribution

<Steps>
<Step>
**Define Your Vision**: Have a clear vision of the information you want to convey, both in synthetic and larger form
</Step>
<Step>
**Identify Missing Information**: If the information is missing to properly display the panel, devise a clear way for the user to contribute it
</Step>
<Step>
**Handle Unavailable Data**: Explain when information is not available on the product packaging

**Panel Generation**

Knowledge panels are generated based on product data and taxonomies, with support for localization and customization.
</Callout>

## How to test that your knowledge panel contribution does not break the app

<Steps>
<Step>
**Setup Local Tunnel**: Use tools such as ngrok.io to open a tunnel from your local development machine to the Internet
</Step>
<Step>
**GitPod Alternative**: If you are using GitPod to run your Product Opener instance, you don't need ngrok as GitPod allows you to make your dev instance URL public
</Step>
<Step>
**Mobile App Testing**: Activate the DEV mode of the official Open Food Facts mobile app, switch the Server to test, and set a custom URL (yours) for the server
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
**Testing is Critical**

Always test your knowledge panel contributions to ensure they don't break the mobile app experience.
