If you are developing a new WebComponent in openfoodfacts-webcomponents project, you might want to test its integration immediately.

To do this you can use the following steps:

## Docker Compose Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Include dev-webcomponents.yml">
We need to include the dev-webcomponents.yml file in the docker-compose.yml file.
</Step>
<Step title="Edit .env file">
Edit your .env to add the following line:

```ini
COMPOSE_FILE_BUILD=docker-compose.yml;docker/dev.yml;docker/dev-webcomponents.yml
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml;docker/dev.yml;docker/dev-webcomponents.yml;docker/run.yml
```

</Step>
<Step title="Define WEBCOMPONENTS_DIR (if needed)">
If your project is located, relatively to your openfoodfacts-server project, at `../openfoodfacts-webcomponents`, you are all set, otherwise you need to define the `WEBCOMPONENTS_DIR` in your .env file to point to the right relative location.
</Step>
<Step title="Caution: Do not commit .env changes">
**BEWARE**: not to commit you .env changes !
</Step>
</Steps>

## If you want to use envrc

There is a caveat if you [use the .envrc file](/docs/Product-Opener/dev/development-environment/how-to-use-direnv) (which as the advantage to be ignored by git), because, in `.env` we define the separator between the different `COMPOSE_FILE` to be `;` which does not work with the `.envrc` syntax.

So you have to define the `COMPOSE_FILE` variable in your `.envrc` file to be `:`.

Which means the changes in your .envrc should be:

```bash
# eventually use this if your location is distinct
# export WEBCOMPONENTS_DIR=../openfoodfacts-webcomponents
export COMPOSE_PATH_SEPARATOR=:
export COMPOSE_FILE_BUILD=docker-compose.yml:docker/dev.yml:docker/dev-webcomponents.yml
export COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker/dev.yml:docker/dev-webcomponents.yml:docker/run.yml
```
