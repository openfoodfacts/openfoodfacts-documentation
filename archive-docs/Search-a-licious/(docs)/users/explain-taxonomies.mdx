Taxonomies are a way to organize categorization of items.
Normally, a taxonomy is about a specific field. For each possible value, it defines translations in different languages, and also possible synonyms (in each language). For each entry we have a canonical identifier.
A taxonomy also organizes the entries within a direct acyclic graph (a hierarchy but with possibility of multiple parents, though always avoiding cycles). For example, it may help describe that a salmon is a marine fish as well as a freshwater fish, and an oily fish.

<Callout type="info">
  It can be used to help users find items using a specific field, in their
  language, even if they use a synonym for it.
</Callout>

## Listing Taxonomies

<Card
  title="Taxonomy Configuration Reference"
  href="/docs/Search-a-licious/users/ref-config/searchalicious-config-schema#indices_additionalProperties_taxonomy"
>
  If you plan to use taxonomies, you should first list them in the taxonomy
  section of the configuration
</Card>

<Callout type="warning">
  Taxonomies must come in a JSON format, that can be downloaded at a particular
  URL.
</Callout>

### JSON Structure

The data in the JSON must contain an object, where:

<Steps>
<Step title="Entry Keys">

Each key corresponds to the id of the taxonomy entries

</Step>
<Step title="Entry Values">

The value is an Object, with the following fields (none are mandatory):

- **`name`**: an Object associating language code, with the entry name in the language (useful for translating the entry)
- **`synonyms`**: an Object associating language code, with an array of synonyms for this entry in this language

</Step>
</Steps>

## Taxonomy Fields

<Card
  title="Field Configuration Guide"
  href="/docs/Search-a-licious/users/explain-configuration#fields"
>
  As you define your fields in the configuration, you can specify that a field
  is a taxonomy field
</Card>

When you specify `type: taxonomy`, you also have to provide the following fields:

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="taxonomy_name"
    description="The name of the taxonomy (as defined in the configuration)"
  />
  <Card
    title="synonyms_search"
    description="If true, adds a full text subfield that enables using synonyms and translations to match this term"
  />
</Cards>

## Autocompletion with Taxonomies

<Callout>
  When you import taxonomies, they can be used to provide autocompletion in
  multiple ways.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step title="Web Component Integration">

The web components can use them to add values to facets, or to provide suggestions in the search bar.

</Step>
<Step title="API Autocompletion">

<Card
  title="Autocompletion API"
  href="/docs/Search-a-licious/ref-openapi#operation/taxonomy_autocomplete_autocomplete_get"
>
  You can also use the autocompletion API directly
</Card>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Importing Taxonomies

<Card
  title="Import Command Reference"
  href="/docs/Search-a-licious/devs/ref-python/cli#python3-m-app-import-taxonomies"
>
  If you defined taxonomies, you must import them using the import-taxonomies
  command
</Card>

## Technical Details on Taxonomy Fields

<Callout type="info">
  A taxonomy field is stored in Elasticsearch as an object.
</Callout>

For each language it has a specific field, but in this field we just store the taxonomy entry id (e.g., for organic, we always store `en:organic`). The analyzer is almost set to `keyword` which means it won't be tokenized (but it is not completely true, as we also transform hyphen to underscore).

<Callout type="warning">
**Field Value Requirements**

The value of this field must be considered a unique token by Elasticsearch standard tokenizer. So you should only use letters, numbers, colons and the underscore.

</Callout>
As an exception, we allow the hyphen character, transforming it to "_" before tokenization.

But those field have a specific _search analyzer_, so that when you enter a search query,
The query text is tokenized using standard analyzer, then lower cased, and we then look for synonyms in the taxonomy.
